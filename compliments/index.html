            You got through your first day! I am proud of you. I am always amazed by how good your Dutch is. You already
            know quite a bit. You are much better than you give yourself credit for. Let's practice some more the
            next 11 days!

    <template x-if="day == 2">
        <p>
            You are so emotionally developed! You can explain your feelings very well, and you can always tell me what
            you need. You also know how I am feeling and can help me with that. For example, after KitKat you knew that
            I wasn't feeling well. You laid with me for a bit, which was really nice. It is one of the best parts about
            you.
        </p>
    </template>
    <template x-if="day == 3">
        <p>
            You are so smart! You can follow my work, you can to watch my deep sea videos with me, and you are able to
            watch math video's with me. You don't shy away from an intellectual challenge. My smart honey :).
        </p>
    </template>
    <template x-if="day == 4">
        <p>
            Your cooking is amazing! I love that you always make lunch and dinner for us. Even though you confessed that
            you don't always want to cook for me, I still love it. I sometimes try to make the same meals that you made
            me, but they are just never the same. Yours are always much better!
        </p>
    </template>
    <template x-if="day == 5">
        <p>
            I like that you have a long list of movies you want to see with me! We don't need to scroll endlessly
            through Netflix. You just have your movies ready. Let's watch one :).
        </p>
    </template>
    <template x-if="day == 6">
        <p>
            You are always beautiful! You have such a good taste in clothing, and you know what fits you well. Your
            outfits are impeccable. And even when you just wear house clothes, I still find you beautiful.
        </p>
    </template>
    <template x-if="day == 7">
        <p>
            You are so good in bed! Not only can you pleasure me very well, but you also communicate very well what I
            need to do to you. I don't need to guess. And that makes sex with you amazing.
        </p>
    </template>
    <template x-if="day == 8">
        <p>
            I love it the most when I come home and I hear my cutie say: "Babieeeeee". You are always so enthusiastic to
            see me. It is the best part of my day :).
        </p>
    </template>
    <template x-if="day == 9">
        <p>
            I love that you push me to always be better. You believe in me, and you also teach me. You show me how to do
            things. You give me feedback. Even when I can be difficult and need some time to adjust, you stick with me.
        </p>

        <p>
            I like it that all your friends love me. It makes life a lot easier that they talk so positively about me.
            And I also like your friends a lot! You have great choice in friends. I like to see them more.
        </p>

            I travel so much more since I am with you. Even though I am not much of a traveler, I like it with you. I
            see a lot of the world. Let's explore more places!

                You are the most loving girlfriend I could wish for. I am ready now. Let's talk about spending the rest
                of our lives together. Are you ready for that?
